        “From the sawdust on the ground to the mounted taxidermy on the walls,
        Hunter is where modern Texans go to relive the turn of the 19th century.
         Their dishes are simple, hearty, fresh, and all-around delicious.”
        — FOOD MAGAZINE



        “By focusing purely on food and ambience, Hunter provides the authenticity
         of the Old West without the costumes and playacting of a themed restaurant.
          You can bring your cowboy boots if you want, but the humble and relaxed
           atmosphere asks that you come as you are.”
        — HUNGRY TIMES



        “Ms. Blackburn has surprised us with her ability to turn pioneer staples
         into gourmet delights. Her signature cocktails are not merely couched in nostalgia,
          but are a genuine rebirth of western saloon classics.”
        — AUSTIN DAILY



        “Good food and cocktails are one thing, but this place had me sold with its
         twenty beers on tap. From your regular joes to your craft brew snobs, Hunter 
         has something for everyone and brings the saloon life back to Texas.
          All they need now is a pianola.”
